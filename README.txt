Assuming node.js is already installed

1. Open a command prompt in the "pizza-app-client" directory.
2. Execute "npm run start". This will automatically open the react app.
3. You will be prompted by the order page. Proceed with your order.
4. At the end of the process, the "Proceed to checkout" button is supposed to call on the api to send the order data. This is not covered in the UI. 
5. I intended to do the backend for the bonus point, but i chose to refine the UI as the position is for front-end developer.
